## Poisonous mushrooms - PCA, KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Models

This is a project based on a classic dataset on poisonous mushrooms. It contains over 8000 observations, where each mushroom is described by a variety of features like color, odor, etc., and the target variable is an indicator for whether the mushroom is poisonous. The feature set is binarized, as all the observations are categorical.

This project is based on a homework assignment for the MIDS (Masters in Data Science) program at The University of California, Berkeley.
